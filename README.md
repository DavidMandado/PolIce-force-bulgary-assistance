# PolIce-force-bulgary-assistance
TU/e Multidisciplinary CBL, helpin London police force reduce burlgary rates by predicting crime, allocating their police officers and adding our original twist by including the community in our innovative solution.

This README will give the information necessary to run the project and a summary of its content.

## Our goal
The aim of this project was a vague problem to which we had to find a solution, how can we, as a team of Data Scientists and Computer Scientists help the London police force in reducing burglary rates. 

The most obvious solution was predicting burglaries for future month(s). However, we were not satisfied by this solution, and considered that a big part of the police force is not only to reduce the numerical value of burglary rates, but also to make the community feel safe and protected by them, this is why we have developed a solution that not only predicts burglaries with up to 80% R^2, but also takes input from the London community and uses it to give police more in-depth insights.
