# PolIce force bulgary assistance - Fighting to reduce residential burglary
TU/e Multidisciplinary CBL, helping London police force reduce burlgary rates by predicting crime, allocating their police officers and adding our original twist by including the community in our innovative solution.

This README will give the information necessary to run the project and a summary of its content. This repository was created due to many members having issues in the git history after pushing big data files. This is the second repository used in the project, avoiding the previous problem using a detailed gitignore file. To access the previous repository to see previous group history you can view:

## Our GOAL
The aim of this project was a vague problem to which we had to find a solution, how can we, as a team of Data Scientists and Computer Scientists help the London police force in reducing burglary rates. 

The most obvious solution was predicting burglaries for future month(s). However, we were not satisfied by this solution, and considered that a big part of the police force is not only to reduce the numerical value of burglary rates, but also to make the community feel safe and protected by them, this is why we have developed a solution that not only predicts burglaries with up to 80% R^2, but also takes input from the London community and uses it to give police more in-depth insights.

## Our SOLUTION - in detail

### Community Tool
Collects and visualises citizen's perceptions of safety, through open and closed questions.

* **Location:** `community-tool/`
* **What it does**
  * Responsive survey form (Likert + open-text).
  * Live charts of perceived-safety scores and topic sentiment versus borough averages.
* **Tech stack:** plain HTML + JS (Plotly, D3) — no server needed once the processed CSVs are present.
* **Run / deploy**
  1. Ensure `data/topic_sentiment_summary.csv` (and any other processed survey outputs) are in the `data/` folder.
  2. Open `community-tool/dashboard.html` in a browser.  
     *Tip: host the folder on GitHub Pages or Netlify for a public deployment.*
The most recommended method to view this part of the project is installing the Live Server extension and opening the index.html file with it.


### 🛡️ Police Dashboard
An interactive Dash application for analysts and duty officers.

* **Location:** `Police-dashboard/app.py`
* **Main features**
  1. **Map view**  
     * Ward- or LSOA-level choropleths of burglary counts (historical **or** predicted).  
     * Drill-down: click a ward to reveal constituent LSOAs plus a patrol allocation table.
  2. **Control panel**  
     * Toggle Past / Predicted data, pick date ranges, upload a new month of raw crime CSVs, download auto-generated patrol schedules.
  3. **Perception Analysis modal**  
     * Pops up on demand to show community sentiment bars (and any extra visuals you wire in).
* **Run locally**
  ```bash
  cd Police-dashboard
  pip install -r requirements.txt     # Dash, Plotly, geopandas, xgboost, etc.
  python app.py
